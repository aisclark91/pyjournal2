-- need to create the abilty to add links for files (e.g. long PDFs)

   pj entry --link long.pdf [topic [images]]

   this will do

   :download:`file.pdf <file.pdf>`

-- need to do the building of the sphinx stuff -- this means adding
   to the main.rst

-- need to create a topic directory if one does not already exist
   (with prompting)



differences from old pyjournal:

 -- there is only one journal (with separate topic sections) instead
    of multiple journals

 -- we now have topics

 -- there is only one entry file per day -- this largely eliminates the
    need for editing old entries
